# To Do:
    1. Tuesday January 18, 2022:
        a. ✅ Decide on team member roles
        b. ✅ Get AWS account login info from course instructors
        c. ✅ Decide how to complete the work:
            Who will do the work, when, divide and conquer or together?
            Michael Forrester: Teams will have at least 1 hour per class time for working with our team (do labs outside of class time). The last week of the course we will have the full class time to work together.
            ✅ Thursday night let’s start together and take notes.
    2.Thursday January 20, 2022:
        a. ✅ Go through the Serverless project exactly step by step as written
            What issues and pitfalls are we running into? Installing AWS CLI on Windows
            Discuss what needs to be changed to meet the project requirements
            Discuss what to make it better/prettier?
            Use GitHub instead of AWS CodeCommit
            Customize background pictures/words (Unicorns -> Tesla rides, rhinos, moose, hockey?). Each modification in a different branch.
            Also, submit this Google document as a Readme file
            Discuss what to change in the code to practice code commiting and deploying.
            Go through the Serverless project again, with modifications, substituting technologies and different pictures/words as desired/necessary
    3. Figure out what to put on GitHub.


4. Notes/Pitfalls:
Tip from Michael: If we use GitHub, there is no “master” branch. Instead, it is the “main” branch.
